# LARAVEL_API

## Project Overview

The "LARAVEL_API" project is focused on the development of a JSON API using PHP and Laravel. It involves creating and testing the API with PHP, performing data retrieval operations via a FETCH request, and then replicating these operations in Laravel by utilizing the pre-programmed API.

## Technologies Used

- **PHP**: The project begins with the development of a JSON API using PHP. This serves as the foundation for subsequent operations.

- **Laravel**: The Laravel framework is leveraged to recreate the same API functionality. Laravel simplifies the development process and provides a structured approach.

- **MVC (Model-View-Controller)**: The project adheres to the MVC design pattern, with a focus on the VC (View-Controller) components.

## Project Phases

The project is divided into several key phases:

1. **PHP JSON API**: In this initial phase, a JSON API is developed using PHP. Data retrieval and testing are performed with PHP, and FETCH requests are used to access the data.

2. **Laravel Implementation**: The project then transitions to Laravel, where the existing API is replicated. Laravel's framework is utilized to streamline the development process.

3. **Customized URL Handling**: Laravel allows for customization of URLs to access data in JSON format. This is achieved to enhance data accessibility and interaction.

4. **MVC Pattern**: Throughout the Laravel implementation, the project focuses on the VC (View-Controller) components of the MVC design pattern. Data is loaded using controllers and sent to views.

## Testing and Validation

The project emphasizes testing and validation at various stages. It ensures that the API functions correctly, both in the PHP implementation and the Laravel version.

## Conclusion

The "LARAVEL_API" project is a comprehensive exploration of JSON API development using PHP and Laravel. It demonstrates the process of creating, testing, and replicating APIs while adhering to structured design patterns. By following this approach, the project aims to enhance data accessibility and interaction through customized URLs and MVC-based data loading. It serves as a valuable learning experience for PHP and Laravel developers looking to work with JSON APIs.
